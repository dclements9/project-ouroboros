# Project Ouroboros

## YouTube Video Looper Project
    
    Loops YouTube videos indefinietly.

    Uses **Local Storage** to allow the previous 'Loop' to be saved for later reference.

## Install & Use
    1. `git clone https://github.com/dclements9/project-ouroboros.git`
    2. Open index.html in a web browser. 
    3. Enter the YouTube link into the input field
    4. Press the button and Fire Away!

    Note: If you've previously visited this site and entered a YouTube video, the Local Storage entry will remember your previous 'Loop'.

## Live Demo 
    https://www.project-ouroboros.com/

Note: Live Demo still uses cookies instead of local storage. Will update soon.

## TODO
1. List all previous loops (More than most recent one)
2. Give choice to delete previous loops from local storage.
